Security+ notes

CIA's of Security
  Confidentiality - keeping data secret from people who do not have the need to access the data
  Integrity - ensures data and systems stay in an altered store when data is stored, transmitted, or recieved
  Availability - systems are available to authorized users when needed

  Auditing and Accountability - keeping track of whats been going on (logging)
  Non-Repudiation - User cannot deny making some form of cummication.

Risk Management
  (threats x Vulnerabilities = risk)
  Potential to harm organizations or people
  NIST SPA-800-37

  Assets - Part of infrasture that we are worried about getting harmed.
    people/computers
    reputations
  Vulnerabilities - Weakness to a asset that leaves it access to something bad to happen
  Threat - negative event that exploits a Vulnerability
    Threat Agent - Often a human being doing something
  Likelihood - Defines the level certainty that something bad is going to happen
    Quantitative - Can put a number to the risk (looking at data for powersupply going out)
    Qualitative - Hard to put a number to (customer loyalty)
  Impact - is the harm caused by a threat.
    Can be measured by cost/labor

Threat Actors
  Internal or External
  Resources
  Funding
  Intent - What's their motivation
  Open-source Intelligence (OSINT) - Facebook, google.

  Script Kiddies - Trivial attack knowledge, easily blocked with good firewall
  Hacktivist - Intent is motivation
  Organized Crime - Very smart groups of people who want to make money
  Nation states/advanced persistent threat (APT)
    APT - They get into a system and stay there.
  Insiders - Someone within the organization. Works within the infrasture, may not be an employee.
  Competitors - Other companies, not as big today.

Managing Risk
  Risk Identification/Risk Assessment
  Vulnerability Assessment
    catalog all the assets
    cve.mitre.org - Common vulnerabilities and exposure database
    Nessus - Used to check network for vulnerabilities
    Penetration Testing - outside party tries to do something to your network
  Threat Assessment
    Adversarial - Hacker or Malware
    Accidental - User accidentally types something in your form and causes it to show the database
    Structural - PS on router dies, could include software fails
    Environmental - fires/earthquakes
  Risk Response
    Mitigation - is effort to reduce impact of risk
    Risk transferance - Offloads risk onto a third-party
    Risk acceptance - reach a point where likelihood and impact cost exceeds the ability to mitigate.
    Risk avoidance - Likelihood and impact is so high that you don't want to deal with it
  Framework - is a process/methodology that tells you how to manage your risks
    NIST Risk Management Framework Special Publication 800-37
    ISACA Risk IT Framework
    IAMIS

Using guides in Risk Assessment
  How do we secure stuff?
  Benchmark - use threshold values to verify expected throughput or action
  Secure Configuration Guide - [comptia is pushing]
    Platform and Vendor specific guides
    NIST has a guide, (secure configuration)
    Securing wireless networks - SP 800-153

Security Controls [compare and contrast various types of controls]
  Security Control (its a verb) - What you do to secure your network
    Apply, Monitor and Adjust security controls
    Administrative Control (Management Controls)
      Laws
      Policies
      Guidelines
      Best Practices
    Technical Control - Control actions IT systems towards IT security
      Computer stuff
      Firewalls
      Password Links
      Authentication
      Encryption
