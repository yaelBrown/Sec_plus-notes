Security+ notes

CIA's of Security
  Confidentiality - keeping data secret from people who do not have the need to access the data
  Integrity - ensures data and systems stay in an altered store when data is stored, transmitted, or recieved
  Availability - systems are available to authorized users when needed

  Auditing and Accountability - keeping track of whats been going on (logging)
  Non-Repudiation - User cannot deny making some form of cummication.

Risk Management
  (threats x Vulnerabilities = risk)
  Potential to harm organizations or people
  NIST SPA-800-37

  Assets - Part of infrasture that we are worried about getting harmed.
    people/computers
    reputations
  Vulnerabilities - Weakness to a asset that leaves it access to something bad to happen
  Threat - negative event that exploits a Vulnerability
    Threat Agent - Often a human being doing something
  Likelihood - Defines the level certainty that something bad is going to happen
    Quantitative - Can put a number to the risk (looking at data for powersupply going out)
    Qualitative - Hard to put a number to (customer loyalty)
  Impact - is the harm caused by a threat.
    Can be measured by cost/labor

Threat Actors
  Internal or External
  Resources
  Funding
  Intent - What's their motivation
  Open-source Intelligence (OSINT) - Facebook, google.

  Script Kiddies - Trivial attack knowledge, easily blocked with good firewall
  Hacktivist - Intent is motivation
  Organized Crime - Very smart groups of people who want to make money
  Nation states/advanced persistent threat (APT)
    APT - They get into a system and stay there.
  Insiders - Someone within the organization. Works within the infrasture, may not be an employee.
  Competitors - Other companies, not as big today.

Managing Risk
  Risk Identification/Risk Assessment
  Vulnerability Assessment
    catalog all the assets
    cve.mitre.org - Common vulnerabilities and exposure database
    Nessus - Used to check network for vulnerabilities
    Penetration Testing - outside party tries to do something to your network
  Threat Assessment
    Adversarial - Hacker or Malware
    Accidental - User accidentally types something in your form and causes it to show the database
    Structural - PS on router dies, could include software fails
    Environmental - fires/earthquakes
  Risk Response
    Mitigation - is effort to reduce impact of risk
    Risk transferance - Offloads risk onto a third-party
    Risk acceptance - reach a point where likelihood and impact cost exceeds the ability to mitigate.
    Risk avoidance - Likelihood and impact is so high that you don't want to deal with it
  Framework - is a process/methodology that tells you how to manage your risks
    NIST Risk Management Framework Special Publication 800-37
    ISACA Risk IT Framework
    IAMIS

Using guides in Risk Assessment
  How do we secure stuff?
  Benchmark - use threshold values to verify expected throughput or action
  Secure Configuration Guide - [comptia is pushing]
    Platform and Vendor specific guides
    NIST has a guide, (secure configuration)
    Securing wireless networks - SP 800-153

Security Controls [compare and contrast various types of controls] - threat actors doing something to us
  Security Control (its a verb) - What you do to secure your network
    Apply, Monitor and Adjust security controls
    Administrative Control (Management Controls)
      Laws
      Policies
      Guidelines
      Best Practices
    Technical Control - Control actions IT systems towards IT security
      Computer stuff
      Firewalls
      Password Links
      Authentication
      Encryption
    Physical Control - actions real world actors make against IT
      Gates
      Guards
      Keys
      Man Traps
  Security Control functions
    Deterrent - deters the act from attempting the threats
    Preventive - deters the actor from performing the threat
    Detective - recognizes an actors threat
    Corrective - Mitigates the impact of a manifested threat
    Compensating - provides alternative fixes to any of the above functions
  [What type of security control needs to be applied for that situation]

Interesting Security Control
  Mandatory Vacation - Used to detect fraud and unauthorized activity
  Job Rotation - Periodically switiching people around to work in different positions.
    Avoids contempt of position
  Multi-person control - More than one person is required to perform a task or control.
  Seration of Duties - [Administrative Control] Single individual should not perform all critical privledge duties across the board
  Principle of Least privledge - People get enough privledge to perform the tasks they need.

Defense in depth or Layered Security
  Diversity vs Redundancy - Trench system, a lot of trenches.
    Good defense in depth, also has good Diversity

IT Security Governance
  Laws and Regulations
    ex. HIPAA
  Standards
    ex. ISO, NIST, PCI-DSS
  Best Practices
    ex. Microsoft Best Practices
  Common Sense
    good ole common sense and experience
    What just sounds right
    What worked in the Past
  Policies
    broad in nature
    used as directives
    Define roles and Responsibilities
  Organization Standards
    Level of performance for a policy
      it must be 12 chars alphanum etc
  Security Controls are in Policies and Standards
    Not usually a big list
  Procedures
    Step by step process how to do something
    How to do the task

Security Policies
  [know all the policies for exam]
  Acceptable Use Policies - What a person can or cannot do on company assets
    No pornograpy or ebay
  Data Sensitivity and Classification Policies - How to define how important things all
  Access Control Policies - How people get access to data and other resources
    Fairly big document
  Password Policy - How you will define passwords
    Password recovery
    Bad login
    Password Retention
    Password reuse
  Care and Use of equipment - How you maintain company equipment, what are your Responsibilities
  Privacy Policies - Often applied to customers
  Personnel Policies - background checks, security clearances

Framworks
  A Process Idea
    Regulatory
    Non-Regulatory
    National Standards
    International Standards
    Industry-specific Frameworks
  NIST SP800-37
    First and goto place.
    Risk Management Framework
    6 Steps
      Categorize - identify assessts
      Select - select security controls
      Implement - implement controls
      Assessment - verify controls are working
      Authorize - big boss makes final decision
      Monitor - stay on top of controls, watch them. Process gets repeated after this.
  ISACA IT Framework
  ISO 27000

Quantitative Risk Calculations
  [Will need to know how to generate these calculations on the exam]
  Assesing asset values
    Asset Value
  Exposure Factor - Percentage of an asset that's lost as a result of an incident
    1 = Complete write off. (Floor in Server room)
  Single Loss Expectancy (SLE) - Asset Value * Exposure Factor
  Annualize Rate of Occurrance (ARO) - Chance of Loss to happen.
  Annualize Loss Expectancy (ALE) - SLE * ARO
    Important Value, Cost of that incident
  Mean Time To Repair (MTTR) - How long it takes to repair an asset after it has failed
  Mean Time To Fail (MTTF) - How long it takes for working equipment to fail
